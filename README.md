# Cexplorer community

With the recent update to [Cexplorer.io](https://cexplorer.io), there have been several changes and improvements to open sourcing and resource sharing.

## Groups 
💠 __Navigation__ [template file](/mainnet/groups/template.json)  
💠 __Enviroments__ [mainnet groups](/mainnet/groups) | [preprod groups](/preprod/groups) | [preview groups](/preview/groups)

The groups folder contains individual groups. Groups can contain pools or/and dreps. You can add additional information such as description, image, etc. to groups. You can modify an existing group or create a new one. After PR approval, usually by the next day, the data is projected on cexplorer.
